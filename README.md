### Election-Audit Summary: 

The script used for this exercise was based on the importing of the information from a CSV file. This can be used for future electiones because the lists, dictionaries and variables were calculated from cero value. If the new data for upcoming elections is in the same format, we would be able to run this exact script and produce similar results. Please see the below image for additional details.
